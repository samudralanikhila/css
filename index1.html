    <h3 class="b">CSS can be added to <i>HTML</i> documents in 3 ways:</h3>
    <ul class="g">
        <li>inline-by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal-by using a style element in the head sestion</li>
        <li>External-by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add css. is to keep the style in external CSS fileHowever. <b class="h">In this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</b> because this is easier in demonstrate. and easier for you to try it yourself</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="i">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements .ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element .ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript</p>
    <p class="i">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of style can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p class="i">There is a wide range of selectors avaliable.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
